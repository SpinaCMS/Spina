## Getting Started
[Read the guide](https://www.spinacms.com/docs) to learn more about how to use Spina. If you just want to get started, create a new Ruby on Rails app and follow these instructions:

Add the following line to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'spina'
```

Run the installer to start the setup process:

    rails spina:install

The installer will help you create your first user interactively.

Then start `rails s` and access Spina at `/admin`.

## Browser support
Spina's admin UI requires Chrome/Edge 89+, or any other browser with basic ESM support (Safari/Firefox). This is due to a recent browser feature called `import maps` and will be used in Rails 7 as the default way to deploy javascript assets.

Browser support for websites built with Spina is entirely up to the developer. Spina doesn't force you to build your frontend a certain way.
