# Introduction

Spina is a content management system (CMS) that focuses on ease of use. We believe that managing content should not involve HTML, CSS or configuration. 

You as a designer, developer or all-round maker decide how your new website looks and feels. Clients who use Spina can then simply add their content without messing up your work. This means better looking websites and fewer small requests from clients!

We could try explaining why it works so well, but it's probably best we show you:
