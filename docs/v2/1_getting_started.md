# Getting started

Spina is a CMS for Rails 6.1. If you want to get started quickly, create a new Ruby on Rails app with a PostgreSQL database and ActiveStorage enabled and follow these instructions:

Add the following line to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'spina'
```

Run the installer to start the setup process:

    rails spina:install

The installer will help you create your first user.

Then start `rails s` and access Spina at `/admin`.
