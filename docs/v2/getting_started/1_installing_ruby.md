# Installing Ruby

Before you can install Spina, you need to have Ruby and Rails installed first. Here are a couple of excellent resources to do that:

- [Install Ruby on Rails (gorails.com)](https://gorails.com/setup)
- [Installing Ruby (ruby-lang.org)](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)
- [Getting Started with Rails (guides.rubyonrails.org)](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html)

## Database

You need a database to store all of your content. Spina CMS requires a PostgreSQL database. You can install it using several ways. If you're on a Mac we recommend using `homebrew` so you can simply run `brew install postgresql`.
