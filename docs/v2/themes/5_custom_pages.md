# Custom pages

You can define custom pages for your theme that will be generated when bootstrapping your website. You can define whether or not they're deletable. By default Spina creates a custom page named Homepage which is not deletable. This default custom page is set as the homepage of your theme. You can change this later using the Theme menu of the Admin panel. Or you can override this in the theme file by setting `homepage: true` on a different custom page.
